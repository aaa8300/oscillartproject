# OsciLINE 

**OsciLINE** is a creative sound + visual website that turns typed musical notes (C, D, E, etc.) into animated waveforms. This was made for Hack Club's Athena Award YSWS 'Oscillart'. 

## Why I Made This
As a math lover, this project stood out to me because it blends math, sound, and visual art in such a fun way. I wanted to explore how code can create interactive, artistic experiences.

## How I Made It
I followed the Oscillart tutorial to understand how sound and visuals can be connected in the browser using the Web Audio API and HTML canvas. Then I customized the project to make it my own — I added interactive UI controls, styled everything, added recording, and let users change wave thickness as it plays.

## How It Works
- Type in notes like `CDEFG`.
- Press **Play notes!** to hear the tones and watch the animated waveform.
- Customize the wave **color**, **volume**, and **line thickness** in real-time.
- You can **record** the animation and audio.

## Custom Features I Added
- Styled the UI with modern controls
- Let users change the **line thickness** of the wave
- Added a custom gradient background
- Chose the name **Osciline** (inspired by Oscillart) 

## What I Struggled With
- Syncing the wave drawing exactly with the audio
- Changing the line width in real time
- Getting the layout to look clean with CSS

## What I Learned
- How to use the JS Web Audio API  
- How to animate canvas in sync with sound  
- How to tweak and personalize existing code
- How to use VS Code and Git

## Time Spent
About **7 hours** — learning, experimenting, debugging, and customizing.
